The rules are the same as the original chess game, except that the pieces are placed in a 3x3 board numbered as follow:  
`| 0 | 1 | 2 |`   
`| 3 | 4 | 5 |`  
`| 6 | 7 | 8 |`  
The computer player is black and the human player is white. The legal moves for the current player (white) are shown at the lower-right of the screen. You can either input the moves in the box or click on the chess piece, and press MOVE button. The winner is declared when there are no legal moves left, or it may end up to be a tie game.
